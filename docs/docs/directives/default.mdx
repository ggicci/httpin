# default

Introduced in v0.8.0.

**default** is a [directive executor](/advanced/concepts#directive-executor) who
populates **unset fields** to their default values while decoding, and populates
**zero fields** to their default values while encoding.

- **unset fields**: fields that have not been set by former directives.
- **zero fields**: values are zero values, such as `0`, `""`, `false`, `nil`,
  `[]`, `map[]`, `struct{}`.

## Signature

```yaml
Name: "default"
Args: VAL1 [,VAL2 [,VAL3, ...]]
```

:::caution

For an array type of value, you can use comma to separate the items in the array.
So the presence of comma in an array item can lead to unexpected behavior.

:::

## Decoding

**default** will examine if the field has already been set by former directives. If not, it will set the field to the given value.

### Usage

```go
type ListTasksQuery struct {
	Page      int      `in:"query=page;default=1"`
	PerPage   int      `in:"query=per_page;default=20"`
	StateList []string `in:"query=state;default=pending,running"`
}
```

<InputOutputTable
  inputTitle={data.inputOutput.inputTitle}
  outputTitle={data.inputOutput.outputTitle}
  rows={data.inputOutput.rows}
></InputOutputTable>


## Encoding

**default** will examine if the field is a zero value. If so, it will set the field to the given value.

:::caution


Since httpin runs the directives in the order of their appearance in the struct,
you should **always** define the order of the directives based on decoding
requirements, **default** should be placed after directives like
[query](/directives/query) and [path](/directives/path) that set the field
values. In order to make it also works for encoding, httpin will reorder the
directives internally while encoding. The **default** directive will be placed
at the beginning of the reordered directives. For example, the above struct will be reordered to:

```
type ListTasksQuery struct {
	Page      int      `in:"default=1;query=page"`
	PerPage   int      `in:"default=20;query=per_page"`
}
```

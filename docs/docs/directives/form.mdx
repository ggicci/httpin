# form

**form** is a [directive executor](/advanced/concepts#directive-executor) who decodes/encodes a field from/to HTTP form data, i.e. [`http.Request.Form`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Request).

## Signature

```yaml
Name: "form"
Args: KEY1 [,KEY2 [,KEY3, ...]]
```

## Decoding

**form** will examine values of the keys one by one (KEY1 -> KEY2 -> ...) from the form data, the **first non-empty** value will be used to set the corresponding field of the input struct.

:::caution

In most cases, the `form` directive just works like [`query`](/directives/query). Because it also visits data from the URL querystring.
But if the form data sent by the client was of [`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST) content type, `form` will visit the form data first,
and then visit the URL querystring.

For more details, please refer to [GH-5 add a query directive to pull values from querystring params #6](https://github.com/ggicci/httpin/pull/6#issuecomment-939273364) and the following quotes.

:::

From the Go documentation:

> Form contains the parsed form data, including both the URL field's query parameters and the PATCH, POST, or PUT form data.
> This field is only available after ParseForm is called.

And for [`http.Request.ParseForm`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Request.ParseForm), it is:

> `ParseForm` populates `r.Form` and `r.PostForm`.
> For all requests, `ParseForm` parses the raw query from the URL and updates `r.Form`.
> For POST, PUT, and PATCH requests, it also reads the request body, parses it as a form and puts the results into both `r.PostForm` and `r.Form`.
> Request body parameters take precedence over URL query string values in `r.Form`.

### Usage

```go
type Profile struct {
	Role     string `in:"form=role"`
	Hireable bool   `in:"form=hireable"`
}
```

<InputOutputTable
  inputTitle={data.inputOutput.inputTitle}
  outputTitle={data.inputOutput.outputTitle}
  rows={data.inputOutput.rows}
></InputOutputTable>


## Encoding

**form** will encode the field value to the form data with the key specified in the directive argument, the first key will be used, i.e. `KEY1`, results in `http.Request.Form[KEY1] = VALUE`.

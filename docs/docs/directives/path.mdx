# path

**path** is a [directive executor](/advanced/concepts#directive-executor) who decodes/encodes a field from/to the path of the request URI, aka. path variables.

:::danger

**httpin** doesn't provide a builtin **path** directive, because **httpin** doesn't provide routing functionality.
But **httpin** can be easily integrated with other packages that provide routing functionality, to decode path variables.

:::

You can quickly implement a **path** directive with the following code (routing package specific):

- go-chi/chi

```go
import httpin_integration "github.com/ggicci/httpin/integration"

func init() {
    httpin_integration.UseGochiURLParam("path", chi.URLParam)
}
```

- gorilla/mux

```go
import httpin_integration "github.com/ggicci/httpin/integration"

func init() {
    httpin_integration.UseGorillaMux("path", mux.Vars)
}
```

Please visit the **Integrations** section on the left sidebar to find more details on how to integrate **httpin** with other packages.

If you can't find the package you wanted on the list, you could either open an issue on the [**Github**](https://github.com/ggicci/httpin/issues)
or visit [Custom ðŸ”Œ](/directives/custom) to learn to implement a "path" directive of your own.

We do hope that you would like to make contributions to the **httpin** project to make it better!

# path

**path** is a [directive executor](/advanced/concepts#directive-executor) who decodes a field from the path of the request URI, aka. path variables.

:::danger

**httpin** doesn't provide a builtin **path** directive, because **httpin** doesn't provide routing functionality.
But **httpin** can be easily integrated with other packages that provide routing functionality, to decode path variables.

:::

You can quickly implement a **path** directive with the following code (routing package specific):

- go-chi/chi

```go
httpin.UseGochiURLParam("path", chi.URLParam)
```

- gorilla/mux

```go
httpin.UseGorillaMux("path", mux.Vars)
```

You could visit the pages under the **Integrations** section in the sidebar to find more details on how to integrate **httpin** with other packages.

If you can't find the package you wanted in the list, you could either open an issue on the [**Github**](https://github.com/ggicci/httpin/issues)
or visit [custom 🔌](/directives/custom) to learn to implement a "path" directive of your own.

We also hope that you can make contributions to the **httpin** project to make it great! Thanks in advance ❤️

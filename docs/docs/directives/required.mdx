# required

**required** is a [directive executor](/advanced/concepts#directive-executor) who tags a field as required. The "required" here **doesn't mean the final value after decoding must be non-zero**, it means **the key/field must be present in the input data**. If you want to ensure the value not to be zero/empty, use [nonzero](/directives/nonzero) instead.

**required** always works as an accompany with some other directives. How it works is that **it checks whether the field had been set by the former directives**. Which means if you use **required** alone, or put it at the first place of the directives, it will always return an error "missing required field".

## Signature

```yaml
Name: "required"
Args: (no args)
```

## Decoding

When the field were not set by the former directives, an error "missing required field" will occur.

### Usage

```go
type TokenInput struct {
	// Make sure the access_token is present in the query string, we don't care about the value.
	// The value can be empty, e.g. `?access_token=`.
	Token string `in:"query=access_token;required"`
}
```

<InputOutputTable
  inputTitle={data.inputOutput.inputTitle}
  outputTitle={data.inputOutput.outputTitle}
  rows={data.inputOutput.rows}
></InputOutputTable>


## Encoding

Useless.

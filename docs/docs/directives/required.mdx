# required

**required** is a [directive executor](/advanced/concepts#directive-executor) who tags a field as required. Worth to mention, **it was designed to ensure the key to be present in the input data, but doesn't check the value, it can be zero values, like `0`, `""`, etc.** If you want to ensure the value not to be zero/empty, use [nonzero](/directives/nonzero) instead.

## Definition

```yaml
Name: "required"
Args: (no args)
```

**required** always works as an accompany with some other directives, **it checks whether the field had been set by the former directives**. When the field were not set by the former directives, an error "missing required field" will occur.

## Usage

```go
type TokenInput struct {
	// Make sure the access_token is present in the query string, we don't care about the value.
	// The value can be empty, e.g. `?access_token=`.
	Token string `in:"query=access_token;required"`
}
```

<InputOutputTable
  inputTitle={data.inputOutput.inputTitle}
  outputTitle={data.inputOutput.outputTitle}
  rows={data.inputOutput.rows}
></InputOutputTable>
